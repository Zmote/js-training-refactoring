# js-training-refactoring

Note: For this repo to work, you need to download the ace editor code from here: [Ace Editor Github](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds). After you've cloned the repo, copy it's content and paste it under this projects js/ace-builds folder.

Refactor the Code in smellyCode.js as far as possible, use:
- Extract Method
- Extract Class
- Inline Temp
- Replace Temp With Query
- Decompose Conditional
- ...

Look for following Code Smells:
- Long Method
- Conditional Complexity
- Duplicate Code
- Dead Code
- Long Parameter List
- Temporary Field
- ...

Check regularly that the functionality of the code isn't broken.
